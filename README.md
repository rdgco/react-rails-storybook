This is close to working, however I'm unable to get the webpack-dev-server running with the rails/webpacker. The storybook command does work with its own webpack configuration. 

I've looked at and tried examples such as this:

https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1004

https://storybook.js.org/docs/configurations/custom-webpack-config/

and this one that uses older versions of packages:

https://github.com/tai2/webpacker-react-example/tree/master/.storybook

To view the storybook view:

* yarn storybook

To view the rails app:

* rails s

The foreman step doesn't work yet.
